<h3>A script that brings the GPT 3.5 Turbo model to your own google doc...</h3>
<p>This is a kind of small project that I was inspired to attempt after seeing Aidan Ouckah script in his internship spreadsheets. I wanted to make this as a version of microsoft copilot except for google docs, yes I am aware that an extension exists that looks better, has more functions, and has 900k users, but I figured this is a good learning opportunity. I included examples of every function that I built so far so you are free to take a look.</p>
